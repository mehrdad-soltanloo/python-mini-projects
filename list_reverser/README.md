# CLI List Manipulator

A Python-based command-line interface (CLI) tool for performing various operations on a list of numbers. The tool allows users to reverse, sort, remove duplicates, filter even/odd numbers, and save the modified list to a file.

## Features

- Reverse the list.
- Sort the list in ascending or descending order.
- Remove duplicates while preserving the original order.
- Filter even or odd numbers.
- Save the modified list to a file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mehrdad-soltanloo/python-cli-list-manipulator.git
   ```

## Usage

To run the script:

```bash
python list_manipulator.py
```

### Algorithm

1. Take user input to provide a list or use a default list.
2. Display a menu of operations:

- Reverse the list.
- Sort the list.
- Remove duplicates.
- Filter even or odd numbers.
- Save the list to a file.

3. Process the user's choice and apply the corresponding function to the list.
4. Display the modified list after each operation.
5. Repeat until the user selects the exit option.

### Step-by-Step Guide

- Input Handling: The program asks the user to either input a list manually or use a predefined list. If the user provides input, it splits the numbers into a list of integers.
- Menu Display: A menu is shown to the user, providing options to manipulate the list.
- Reverse the List: If chosen, the list is reversed using the reverse_list() function.
- Sort the List: The user selects ascending or descending sort, and the list is sorted accordingly.
- Remove Duplicates: Duplicates are removed from the list while maintaining the original order.
- Filter Even or Odd Numbers: The user can filter only even or odd numbers from the list.
- Save the List to a File: The user can save the modified list to a text file.

### Functions Explained

**get_user_list()**

- Purpose: To get the list of numbers from the user or use a default list.
- Why it's used: Allows flexibility for the user to input a list of their choice or fall back to a default list for testing.

**display_menu()**

- Purpose: Displays the available operations for the user.
- Why it's used: Keeps the interface user-friendly by clearly showing available options at each step.

**reverse_list(numbers)**

- Purpose: Reverses the order of the list in place.
- Why it's used: List reversal is a common list operation, and it demonstrates how in-place modifications can be done efficiently using the reverse() method.

**sort_list(numbers)**

- Purpose: Sorts the list either in ascending or descending order.
- Why it's used: Sorting is another common operation. The sorted() function allows sorting without altering the original list unless assigned back.

**remove_duplicates(numbers)**

- Purpose: Removes duplicates from the list while maintaining the original order.
- Why it's used: Pythonâ€™s dict.fromkeys() is a neat trick to remove duplicates while maintaining the original insertion order.

**filter_list(numbers, even=True)**

- Purpose: Filters the list to return either even or odd numbers.
- Why it's used: Demonstrates the use of list comprehensions to perform filtering based on conditions.

**save_to_file(numbers)**

- Purpose: Saves the modified list to a text file.
- Why it's used: Demonstrates file handling in Python by writing data to a file, ensuring results are preserved outside the program.

**main()**

- Purpose: The main loop that handles user input and directs them to the appropriate list manipulation functions.
- Why it's used: Centralizes the logic of the program, ensuring each part of the project interacts correctly.
