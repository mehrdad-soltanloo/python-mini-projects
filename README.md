# Python Mini Projects

Welcome to the **Python Mini Projects** repository! This collection features a series of Python projects that showcase my programming journey, highlight key skills, and serve as step-by-step tutorials for learning Python.

---

## Purpose

This repository is designed to:

- Showcase my programming progress through diverse mini-projects.
- Demonstrate specific programming skills and techniques.
- Serve as an educational resource for others looking to learn Python through hands-on projects.

Each project is structured to provide a step-by-step learning experience, helping beginners and intermediate learners build their skills with practical examples.

## Projects Overview

Each project is self-contained with its own setup instructions and dependencies. The following table provides an overview of each project:

| Project Name              | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Even-Odd Splitter**     | A tool to separate even and odd numbers from a given list.                |
| **List Reverser**         | Reverses a list of items entered by the user.                             |
| **Task Manager (SQLite)** | A task management app that uses SQLite for data storage.                  |
| **To-Do List**            | A command-line to-do list application with JSON storage.                  |
| **List Sum Calculator**   | Calculates the sum of numbers in a list and allows repeated calculations. |

## Usage Instructions

To explore and run each project:

1. Navigate to the specific project folder.
2. Follow the setup and usage instructions provided in each project's `README.md`.

Each project includes explanations of the code, instructions on how to use it, and suggestions for further improvements. This approach allows learners to understand the purpose of each function and see how the project comes together step-by-step.

---

## Highlights

These projects emphasize:

- **Step-by-Step Learning**: Each project serves as a mini-tutorial, breaking down the code and explaining its functionality to support learning.
- **Clean Code**: Code is organized, formatted, and documented with best practices.
- **Secure Coding**: Basic secure coding principles are applied where relevant, such as input validation and error handling.

---

## Future Additions

This repository will continue to grow as I expand my skills and explore new areas of Python programming. Planned projects include:

- **Calculator CLI Tool**: A simple command-line calculator for arithmetic operations.
- **Web Scraper**: A project to scrape data from websites and process the results.
- **Data Visualizer**: A tool to visualize data from CSV files using `matplotlib` and `pandas`.

## Tutorials and Learning Path

This collection of mini-projects is designed as a **learning path** for Python. Each project builds on foundational concepts, making this repository a progressive tutorial for Python learners. By following these projects in sequence, you'll gradually develop your skills in:

1. **Basic Syntax and Data Types** (Even-Odd Splitter, List Reverser)
2. **Data Manipulation and Storage** (Task Manager with SQLite, To-Do List with JSON)
3. **Command-Line Interfaces and User Interaction** (List Sum Calculator)
4. **Error Handling and Code Structure** (throughout all projects)

This learning path aims to guide learners from simple data manipulation tasks to more complex applications that require data storage, retrieval, and user interaction.
